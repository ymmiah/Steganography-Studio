## ‚ú® Core Features

This application is divided into three main sections: **Analysis**, **Steganography**, and **Crypto Tools**, all running securely in your browser.

### üî¨ Universal Decoder (AI-Powered Analysis)

The star of the studio. This tool is designed to be your first stop for analyzing any potentially suspicious image.

-   **AI Forensic Analysis**: Leverages the **Google Gemini API** to perform a deep forensic analysis of images. It looks for subtle artifacts, unnatural noise, and statistical anomalies that could indicate hidden data, providing a confidence score and detailed reasoning.
-   **Multi-Method Attack**: After the AI analysis, it systematically attempts to decode the image using **every available steganography method** (LSB, Pattern LSB, etc.) with the credentials you provide.
-   **Smart Text Analysis**: Can also analyze raw text payloads. It automatically detects formats like Base64, Hex, or binary, and attempts AES decryption if a password is provided.

### üñºÔ∏è Steganography Methods

Embed your secret messages within images using a variety of techniques. All methods protect your message with strong **AES-GCM encryption** before the hiding process begins.

-   **LSB (Least Significant Bit)**: The classic method. Hides data by altering the least significant bit of each color channel in an image's pixels. Simple and effective for high-capacity storage.
-   **Pattern LSB**: An evolution of LSB. It hides data in a pseudo-random pixel pattern determined by a secret "Stego Key," making it more resilient to basic forensic analysis.
-   **MD5 Pattern LSB**: Enhances the Pattern LSB method by using the MD5 hash of your "Stego Key" to seed the pseudo-random pixel pattern, adding another layer of complexity.
-   **RD (Random Dot) Pattern**: Encodes your encrypted message into a brand new black-and-white image composed of random-looking dots.
-   **Morse Pattern**: Generates a new image that visually represents your encrypted message as a sequence of Morse code signals.

### üîê Cryptographic Toolkit

A suite of powerful tools for various cryptographic tasks.

-   **Multi-Hash Generator**: Instantly generate cryptographic hashes from any text input. Supports a wide range of algorithms:
    -   `MD2`, `MD4`, `MD5`
    -   `SHA-1`, `SHA-224`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-384`, `SHA-512`
-   **MD5 Cracker (Educational Tool)**: A powerful simulator to demonstrate how password hashes are cracked.
    -   **Dictionary Attack**: Attempts to find a match using a wordlist file you provide.
    -   **Brute-force Attack**: Systematically tries every possible combination of characters up to a specified length.
    -   **AI Attack**: Uses the Gemini API to generate a highly targeted list of likely password candidates based on common patterns, then tests them against the hash.
-   **Utilities**:
    -   **Base64 Encoder/Decoder**: Quickly convert text to and from the Base64 format.
    -   **Password Strength Meter**: Analyzes any password in real-time to assess its strength and provides actionable feedback for improvement.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Select a Tool**: Use the sidebar to choose from the available tools. For first-time analysis, the **Universal Decoder** is highly recommended.
2.  **Choose an Action**: For steganography modes, select whether you want to "Encrypt & Hide" or "Extract & Decrypt".
3.  **Provide Inputs**: Fill in the required fields, which may include uploading an image, typing a message, and setting a password or Stego Key.
4.  **Run Process**: Click the main action button to start the encoding, decoding, or analysis.
5.  **View Results**: The output‚Äîwhether it's a new image, a decrypted message, or a detailed report‚Äîwill appear on the right side of the screen.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy First: Client-Side by Design

Your privacy is paramount. All core cryptographic functions, hashing, and steganographic processing are performed **entirely in your browser**.

-   **Your Data Stays With You**: Your files, messages, and passwords are **never** uploaded to any server. They are processed locally on your machine.
-   **API Usage Transparency**: The only exceptions are the AI-powered features, which send only the minimum necessary data to the Google Gemini API for processing (the image for forensic analysis or the target hash for the AI cracker).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

-   **Framework**: React & TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **AI/ML**: Google Gemini API
-   **Cryptography**: Native Web Crypto API for robust, standardized encryption.
-   **Deployment**: Runs as a static client-side application.
