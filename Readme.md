# Steganography Studio

A comprehensive, client-side web application for steganography and cryptography. Hide messages in images, or use the super-advanced Universal Decoder with AI-powered forensic analysis to automatically detect and extract hidden data. Also includes hashing tools, a password cracker, and other utilities.

## ‚ú® Features

### üî¨ Universal Decoder (AI-Powered)
- **AI Forensic Analysis**: Leverages the Gemini API to analyze images for steganographic artifacts, providing a confidence score and detailed reasoning.
- **Multi-Method Attack**: Automatically attempts to decode the image using all available steganography methods (LSB, Pattern-based, etc.).
- **Smart Text Analysis**: Decodes text payloads from various formats like Base64, Hex, or raw binary, and attempts AES decryption if a password is provided.

### üñºÔ∏è Steganography Methods
All methods use strong **AES-GCM encryption** to protect the hidden message before encoding.
- **LSB (Least Significant Bit)**: Hides data in the least significant bits of the image's color channels.
- **Pattern LSB**: Hides data in a pseudo-random pixel pattern determined by a secret "Stego Key". More resilient to basic analysis than standard LSB.
- **MD5 Pattern LSB**: Uses the MD5 hash of a "Stego Key" to seed the pseudo-random pixel pattern for enhanced complexity.
- **RD (Random Dot) Pattern**: Encodes the message into a new black and white random-dot image.
- **Morse Pattern**: Encodes the message into a new image representing the data in visual Morse code.

### üîê Cryptographic Tools
- **Multi-Hash Generator**: Instantly generate hashes from text using MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.
- **MD5 Hash Cracker**: An educational tool to demonstrate hash cracking techniques.
    - **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a provided wordlist.
    - **Brute-force Attack**: Tries all combinations for a given character set and length.
    - **AI Attack**: Uses the Gemini API to generate a contextually aware list of likely passwords to test.
- **Utilities**:
    - **Base64 Encoder/Decoder**: Quickly convert text to and from Base64.
    - **Password Strength Meter**: Analyzes password strength and provides actionable feedback.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Select a Tool**: Use the sidebar on the left to choose a tool. For beginners, the **Universal Decoder** is a great starting point.
2.  **Choose an Action**: For steganography modes, select whether you want to "Encrypt & Hide" or "Extract & Decrypt".
3.  **Provide Inputs**:
    -   Upload an image file.
    -   Type your secret message.
    -   Enter a strong password for encryption/decryption.
    -   Provide a "Stego Key" if using a pattern-based method.
4.  **Process**: Click the main action button to start the process.
5.  **View Results**: The output (encoded image, decrypted text, analysis report) will appear on the right.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React & TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini API
- **Modules**: Loaded via ES Modules from `esm.sh`.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security First: Client-Side Operations

All cryptographic functions, hashing, and steganographic processing are performed **entirely in your browser**. Your files, messages, and passwords are never uploaded to any server, ensuring complete privacy and security.

The only exceptions are the AI-powered features, which send only the necessary data (the image for forensic analysis or the target hash for the AI cracker) to the Google Gemini API for processing.
